### Bio

Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in the political science department at [The University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/) where I research electoral and criminal violence with a focus on gender and research methods. My research interests deal with electoral and criminal violence and its gendered dimension. I am interested in understanding how various forms of violence affects women's political participation in the electoral process. Methodologically, I am interested in the use of causal inference and machine learning.

I was born and raised in California, and attended Oregon State University where I obtained a bachelors degree in Political Science and New Media Communications in 2021. In my free time, I enjoy trail riding and cross-country skiing, and playing any type of games with my friends. I am also a huge fan of Formula1.
